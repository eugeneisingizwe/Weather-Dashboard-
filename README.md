# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to build a five day weather forecast for every city in the USA. 
- This project was built because you want to know a city weather before you pay that city a visit. 
- This project alleviate the uncertainty of not knowing what the weather is going to be for a particular city and for the folllowing five days.  
-  During this project I learned how to use Third-party APIs by accessing their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This is important because developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Thus in this project I learned how to build a weather dashboard that will runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
